this is my web code. I want to run this locally and I want backend version of this. this deployed on my github pages. Now I want to make a "server of my own". so not saving to "localstorage" but keep that option for desired users but now I want accounts. from your previous chats, use bycrypt or what it is and I want sqlinjection proof and I want to see the stats of everything in my server. for the reset password, I want that runs too. for the registration system use username, email and password (retype 2 times). I also want a lightweight ones so it's not that heavy to load database. I ever made this before that's why I know some of the parts. I'm currently running on arch linux VM and bridged adapter
i forgot if I was using postgresql or sqllite but maybe both of them is good to me, I'm a bit confused but maybe I'll go to sqllite. for the authenthication, I want the point A you mentioned but collab with point C but for me account lockout is great. but if the account got locked out, the user got email notif if someone tried to blablabla so maybe the email could provide a access to their datas but not directly to their mails since it's not that secure. for the email verification I'll use that cuz it's important (you know lah). and for reset passwords, send email too with the reset link that lasts only 5 minutes. I also wonder if I should use security questions cuz maybe people forgot the answer but for now when registering (so I just changed my mind, first thing on register is the usual ones getting names username email then password then email confirmation via link or code verification then ask them the security questions, for now include the questions like where do you born, when's your birthdate uhhh I'm not that know but pls help these). I want a admin dashboard of experted and full of stats like my current cpu usage ram and blablabla and current active users (the ones who opening the web right now) and do I need to know the average cashflow too cuz for my own data and knowledge? yea I'm curious too but I don't want to break user's privacy cuz my vision and mission is to keep user's data is private and not sended to anywehre and since this is under gnu or linux or blablabla license. yes include the localstorage fallback. so even it's auto-backuped to my server I want it also saved to localstorage. but for the ones who don't have account use localstorage (anyways I forgot to explain you if there is also a guess section if not logged in just immedately show the frontedn of my web and not saving anything back to my server since it's their own data). And also maybe you should include if they agree with the T&C from linux licenses cuz this is operated by sqllite or portgressql and arch linux. and for the design I found a bug. when it's dark mode the text of when switiching account of money in purse section and savings section of the text menu is like invisible to the placing of round thingy cuz the text color changed to white (if I'm not wrong) and the roundpart thingy makes the text invisible, yes the users could still see but barely cuz it's almost invisible.
wait I almost forgot. I'll run this locally so use localhost cuz I'll think later for the web publishing, just incase maybe if you created something different, please continue
